# Container App that returns the request headers
This sample Azure Resource Manager template deploys a Container App Environment and an Ingress-enabled Container App that returns the list of request headers in the response.

Note: This application is only intended for testing purposes and not for real-world scenarios. Proceed with caution before sending sensitive request headers to this Container App, because the application will return the request headers in the response.
